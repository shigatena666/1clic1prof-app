## Presentation

This project was made during my second academic year of university. We worked as a team of 5 people, but one of them decided to stop and thus, didn't continue to work on the project with us.
The goal was to build a project for a start-up following all the steps of a project: specifications, organisation (Gantt/Pert diagrams) and finally implementing what was needed.
The project works with the .apk (only Android phones) that runs on the client and a server that runs to handle all the necessary operation the client performs.
Approximately a hundred of hours (for me) were spent into that project, all over a semester.
